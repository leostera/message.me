> A demo app built with ng2

#### This is a work in progress.

### Motivation
I wanted to show how ng2 can be used to build very modular web apps. As you can see here I have divided each of the app's sections into different modules.

Stay tuned to see what the outcome is! I'll be hosting this soon online so everyone can try it out.
